    - Margin - Left                      ____________________________________
                                         |           Paragraph              |
                                         |__________________________________|

    - Auto - Automatically calculate by browser
    - Inherit - margin values taken from its parent

        p{margin-bottom:30px;}
        h4{margin-top:40px;} => 40px gap between two elements
