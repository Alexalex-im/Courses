    <h1>SCIENCE - Climate</h1>

    <p>The average weather pattern that prevails over a long period of time in a place is called climate of that place.</p>
    <h3>Adaptions of animals to different climate conditions</h3>
    <div>
    <p>We have already learn about different adaptive features which animals develop to live in different
        habitates such as aquatic, terrestrial and amphibious.
    </p>
    <h3>Adaptation of animals in polar region.</h3>
    <p class="region">Polar region remains covered with snow throughput the year.North polar regionalso called artic region.while south
        polar region is called antartic region.
    </p>
    <p>Some of the countries located in artic region are <span id="count"> canada, greenland, iceland, norway, 
        Finland and sweden</span>.It is very cold there.the sun does not set for 6 month poles and do not raise
